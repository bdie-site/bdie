  <h2>What BDIE Is</h2>
  <p>
    BDIE provides descriptive interpretations of how decisions were formed after the fact.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interpretive, not directive</li>
    <li>Descriptive, not evaluative</li>
    <li>Post-hoc, not real-time</li>
    <li>Non-executing</li>
    <li>Human-responsibility preserving</li>
  </ul>

  <p>BDIE exists to make visible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inputs considered and excluded</li>
    <li>Constraints present at formation time</li>
    <li>Defaults and thresholds applied</li>
    <li>Areas of uncertainty</li>
    <li>Process sequencing effects</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>What BDIE Is Not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Advisory</li>
    <li>Decision-making</li>
    <li>Validation or endorsement</li>
    <li>Optimization or scoring</li>
    <li>Outcome comparison</li>
    <li>Execution or automation</li>
    <li>Real-time participation</li>
    <li>System integration</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Access & Engagement</h2>
  <p>
    Engagements are invitation-only.
  </p>
  <p>
    BDIE conducts paid, written evaluations of historical decisions or simulated decision processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no public onboarding, tooling, or ongoing access.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Boundaries & Independence</h2>
  <p>
    All evaluations are non-advisory, non-authoritative, and non-executing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Responsibility for decisions and outcomes remains entirely external.
  </p>
  <p>
    Methods, internal logic, and systems are not disclosed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use is informational only.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you believe an evaluation may be appropriate, request consideration via email:

  </p>
  <p>
    Silence should be interpreted as non-acceptance.
